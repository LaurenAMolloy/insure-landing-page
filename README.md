## My process

First, I examined the figma files to see what the designs required for both mobile and desktop. I then focused on the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the majority of the page. I made most of the page responsive leaving the nav and the hero image layout for desktop till last.

I knew the nav would be a challenge so I decided to tackle this. After I was happy with the nav, I focused on the hero layout for desktop. Then finally I added the background images.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this process I learnt how to create a responsive nav making using of the active class in CSS and "toggle" using JavaScript. I practiced using media queries, Flexbox and positioning to ensure the nav was responsive.


### Continued development

I would like to continue to build similar pages in terms of layout to get more efficient when buidlign landing pages, specifically the navigation.

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified Nav tut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg) - This helped me create teh navbar. I really liked the simple solution and will use this as a guide when I build more challenges.
